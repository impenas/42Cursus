Get next line
A 42 Lisboa project

With get_next_line it will be possible to read a line ending with a newline character from a file descriptor. This project will allow to learn about static variables and deepen my knowledge about file descriptors, better understanding of allocations of memory, the life cycle and manipulation of a buffer.
