The mission of this project is to re-write useful standard C functions, with the intention of understanding them and learn how to use them, how to build my own library and Makefile.

For the realization of this project, I mainly guided myself through the manual pages to find the original behaviors and prototype. This first part has the following functions: memset, bzero, memcpy, meccpy, memmove, memchr, memcmp, strlen, strdup, strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, strlcat, strchr, strrchr, strstr, strnstr, strcmp, strncmp, atoi, isalpha, isdigit, isalnum, isascii, isprint, toupper and tolower.

In the second part, it was included functions that are either not included in libc, or included in a different form. Those functions are: calloc, strdup, substr, strjoin, strtrim, split, itoa, strmapi, putchar_fd, putstr_fd, putendl_fd and putnbr_fd.

Lastly, in this project I also had the chance to learn about linked lists. This functions help to easily manipulate them: lstnew, lstadd_front, lstsize, lstlast, lstadd_back, lstdelone, lstclear, lstiter and lstmap.
